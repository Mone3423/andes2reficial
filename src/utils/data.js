        "answer": "Citizens from many countries, including the U.S., Canada, and EU members, can enter Bolivia without a visa for stays of up to 90 days. However, as of February 8, 2021, U.S. citizens visiting Bolivia for tourism are required to obtain a tourist visa.

        "answer": "Bolivia is generally safe for tourists, but it's important to stay informed about local conditions. Petty crime, such as pickpocketing, can occur, especially in crowded areas. It's advisable to avoid traveling alone at night and to use reputable transportation options. Political demonstrations, strikes, and roadblocks occur with some frequency in Bolivia, so travelers should avoid these gatherings if possible."

        "question": "When is the best time to visit Bolivia?",
        "answer": "The best time to visit depends on the region: Highlands (La Paz, Uyuni): The dry season from May to October is ideal for clear skies and pleasant temperatures. Amazon Basin: Best visited from May to October, avoiding the rainy season. Lowlands (Santa Cruz, Tarija): The dry season from April to November is optimal for travel."

        "question": "What vaccinations do I need for Bolivia?",
        "answer": "Routine vaccinations are typically sufficient. For certain areas, like the Amazon Basin, vaccinations for Hepatitis A, Typhoid, and possibly Yellow Fever may be recommended. It's best to consult with a healthcare provider before your trip for the most current advice."
